<p>  The Dimebox Institute for Supernova Astrophysics is an informal get-together of supernova scientists from Texas institutions.  The original idea was for the Texas A&M and University of Texas scientists to meet half-way between Austin and College Station in the city of Dimebox.  Dimebox is actually too small to have a restaurant at which to meet, so we have alternated between Austin and College Station.   <br>
<br>
Topics have ranged from ultraviolet through optical and near-infrared observations of supernovae, bolometric light curves, supernova progenitors, and discussion of synergistic programs.
